## Hi, I'm Samiya 👋

I'm a cybersecurity student and analyst, building small but practical security-focused projects as part of my learning journey.

My work mainly involves:
- Password analysis tools
- OSINT-based data collection pipelines
- Email analysis and security-related scripts

I use these projects to better understand real-world security problems and improve my hands-on skills with Python.

📌 This profile is a work in progress — I continuously update it as I learn and build new projects.
